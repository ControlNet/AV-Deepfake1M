This is the official repository for the paper 
[AV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15308).

## Abstract
The detection and localization of highly realistic deepfake audio-visual content are challenging even for the most 
advanced state-of-the-art methods. While most of the research efforts in this domain are focused on detecting 
high-quality deepfake images and videos, only a few works address the problem of the localization of small segments of 
audio-visual manipulations embedded in real videos. In this research, we emulate the process of such content generation 
and propose the AV-Deepfake1M dataset. The dataset contains content-driven (i) video manipulations, 
(ii) audio manipulations, and (iii) audio-visual manipulations for more than 2K subjects resulting in a total of more 
than 1M videos. The paper provides a thorough description of the proposed data generation pipeline accompanied by a 
rigorous analysis of the quality of the generated data. The comprehensive benchmark of the proposed dataset utilizing 
state-of-the-art deepfake detection and localization methods indicates a significant drop in performance compared to 
previous datasets. The proposed dataset will play a vital role in building the next-generation deepfake localization 
methods.

### Metadata Structure

The metadata is a json file for each subset (train, val), which is a list of dictionaries. The fields in the dictionary are as follows.
- file: the path to the video file.
- original: if the current video is fake, the path to the original video; otherwise, the original path in VoxCeleb2.
- split: the name of the current subset.
- modify_type: the type of modifications in different modalities, which can be ["real", "visual_modified", "audio_modified", "both_modified"]. We evaluate the deepfake detection performance based on this field.
- audio_model: the audio generation model used for generating this video.
- fake_segments: the timestamps of the fake segments. We evaluate the temporal localization performance based on this field.
- audio_fake_segments: the timestamps of the fake segments in audio modality.
- visual_fake_segments: the timestamps of the fake segments in visual modality.
- video_frames: the number of frames in the video.
- audio_frames: the number of frames in the audio.
